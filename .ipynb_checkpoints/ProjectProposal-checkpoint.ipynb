    " With grade inflation becoming a growing problem between public and private school we were interested in taking a closer look to see what may be happening within a school. As students, we often hear advice on which professor to take for a certain class because the chances of getting a good grade are higher. For many students at UCSD, who plan to pursue careers that involve more education or careers in their subjectâ€™s job market, GPA is an important factor to look competitive in these fields. This leads students to wait for a class to be taught by a certain professor in order to boost their transcripts and have a higher chance at success. This leads us to our question: what would be the difference in GPA between students that happen to take professors with lower grade distributions relative to their fellow professors?\n",
    "    If we are able to find a large enough disparity between these students, what would be our call to action? Furthermore, what might this reflect on the way classes are being taught, not only at UCSD but at other Universities? As our reference allude to, just because are getting higher grades does not imply that students are performing higher or learning more. The growing competition to get into medical school, grad school, or other competitive career fields incentives students to pursue a higher grade over leaving college with technical skills and knowledge. Also, are the classes with higher distribution, are they not challenging students as much or do they provide a better teaching environment? \n",

By tracking the changes across multiple departments (to have an accurate representation of what is happening campus wide) we can compare how changes at UCSD agree or disagree with national trends. We will also compare the amount of study hours between the courses taught by professors of the same department, this will serve as an indicator on how rigorous classes may be, which may point to the differences in grade distributions. \n",

    "Our data only captures the grade distribution of the class; however it does not reflect the work ethic of students. Some class may have higher grade distributions during certain quarter because students may had better work habits or might have been more motivated because of the quarter. The classes that students chose to take might demand more study hours because how demanding the subject might be. We will not be able to include classes that have missing grade distribution which could potentially have crucial data to analyze the change in distributions over time. A key pitfall could lie in the amount of departments we choose to analyze. In order to get an accurate representation of how grades change in time at UCSD we must make sure that we chose, at least, the minimum amount of departments at UCSD. If we have too little, we could potentially have biased data that shows an inaccurate picture of grade distributions at UCSD. \n",
    "    If our hypothesis is wrong then it would mean that a student could take their courses without having to worry too much about their GPA affected too severely. However, our hypothesis is searching for a .5 difference in GPA, which might not be the most realistic number to use. We would continue to lower to number to see if an actual difference exists. Once we found the actual difference then we could compare those numbers across departments to check if there are similar results throughout the campus. If the difference within and between departments are too small then we would conclude that the effect is too small to make an actual difference in a student's GPA. We would have to do further research to determine why grade inflation is happening on other campuses and why UCSD might be an outlier to the national trend."
