    "## Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "With grade inflation becoming a growing problem between public and private school we were interested in taking a closer look to see what may be happening within a school. As students, we often hear advice on which professor to take for a certain class because the chances of getting a good grade are higher. For many students at UCSD, who plan to pursue careers that involve more education or careers in their subject’s job market, GPA is an important factor to look competitive in these fields. This leads students to wait for a class to be taught by a certain professor in order to boost their transcripts and have a higher chance at success. This leads us to our questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **What would be the difference in GPA between students that happen to take professors with lower grade distributions relative to their fellow professors?**\n",
    "* **If we are able to find a large enough disparity between these students, what would be our call to action?**\n",
    "* **Furthermore, what might this reflect on the way classes are being taught, not only at UCSD but at other Universities?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As our reference allude to, just because they are getting higher grades does not imply that students are performing higher or learning more. The growing competition to get into medical school, grad school, or other competitive career fields incentives students to pursue a higher grade over leaving college with technical skills and knowledge. Also, are the classes with higher distribution, are they not challenging students as much or do they provide a better teaching environment?\n",

    "## Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset used for our project is the UCSD Cape Evaluations, found at https://cape.ucsd.edu/responses/Results.aspx. This dataset has grade distributions for various classes among multiple disciplines at UCSD from Spring quarter 2007 to Spring Quarter 2017. We will be focusing on the following select majors: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Cognitive Science\n",
    "* Biology\n",
    "* Biochemistry\n",
    "* Mechnical and Aerospace Engineering\n",
    "* Chemistry\n",
    "* Computer Science\n",
    "    \n",
    "From these majors, we will be analyzing required major courses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data row has the following columns: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Professor/Instructor\n",
    "* Course\n",
    "* Term\n",
    "* Number of Enrollment\n",
    "* Number of Evaluations Made\n",
    "* Recommended Class\n",
    "* Recommended Instructor\n",
    "* Study Hours/week\n",
    "* Average Grade Expected\n",
    "* Average Grade Received\n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning our data, we will be focusing on Instructor, Course, Term, Rcmnd Instr, Study Hrs/wk, and Avg Grade Received.\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing different students across different professors taken at different times we will be able to analyze any changes between professors as well as pick up on any trends that are happening within a certain department. By tracking the changes across multiple departments (to have an accurate representation of what is happening campus wide) we can compare how changes at UCSD agree or disagree with national trends. We will also compare the amount of study hours between the courses taught by professors of the same department, this will serve as an indicator on how rigorous classes may be, which may point to the differences in grade distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "After scraping the data, we disregard ones with NaN rows and data where the number of evaluations made for the class is under 40%."

We will compare changes in GPA across departments, we can see if UCSD follows national trends while keeping our datapool campus wide. Comparing study hours bewteen the courses taught by professors of the same department allows us to analyze study methods as a descrepency. Ultimately, we are looking to see if students who take professors with higher grade distributions and students who take professors with lower grade distributions and see how much of an impact the difference in professors have on students' overall GPA."
