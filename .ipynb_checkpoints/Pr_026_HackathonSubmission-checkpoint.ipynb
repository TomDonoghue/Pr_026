    "## Introduction and Background\n",
    "\n",
    "With grade inflation becoming a growing problem between public and private school we were interested in taking a closer look to see what may be happening within a school. As students, we often hear advice on which professor to take for a certain class because the chances of getting a good grade are higher. For many students at UCSD, who plan to pursue careers that involve more education or careers in their subjectâ€™s job market, GPA is an important factor to look competitive in these fields. This leads students to wait for a class to be taught by a certain professor in order to boost their transcripts and have a higher chance at success. This leads us to our questions: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **What would be the difference in GPA between students that happen to take professors with lower grade distributions relative to their fellow professors?**\n",
    "* **If we are able to find a large enough disparity between these students, what would be our call to action?**\n",
    "* **Furthermore, what might this reflect on the way classes are being taught, not only at UCSD but at other Universities?**\n",
    "* **How can having a different GPA significantly impact one's future career such as graduate school and job hunting?**\n",
    "\n",
    "As our reference allude to, just because they are getting higher grades does not imply that students are performing higher or learning more. The growing competition to get into medical school, grad school, or other competitive career fields incentives students to pursue a higher grade over leaving college with technical skills and knowledge. Also, are the classes with higher distribution, are they not challenging students as much or do they provide a better teaching environment?\n",

    "The dataset used for our project is the UCSD Cape Evaluations, found at https://cape.ucsd.edu/responses/Results.aspx. This dataset has grade distributions for various classes among multiple disciplines at UCSD from Spring quarter 2007 to Spring Quarter 2017. We will be focusing on the following select majors: \n",

    "* Biology\n",
    "* Biochemistry\n",
    "* Mechnical and Aerospace Engineering\n",
    "* Chemistry\n",
    "* Computer Science\n",
    "    \n",
    "From these majors, we will be analyzing required major courses.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Professor/Instructor\n",
    "* Course\n",
    "* Term\n",
    "* Number of Enrollment\n",
    "* Number of Evaluations Made\n",
    "* Recommended Class\n",
    "* Recommended Instructor\n",
    "* Study Hours/week\n",
    "* Average Grade Expected\n",
    "* Average Grade Received\n",
    "\n",
    "After cleaning our data, we will be focusing on Instructor, Course, Term, Rcmnd Instr, Study Hrs/wk, and Avg Grade Received.\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing different students across different professors taken at different times we will be able to analyze any changes between professors as well as pick up on any trends that are happening within a certain department. By tracking the changes across multiple departments (to have an accurate representation of what is happening campus wide) we can compare how changes at UCSD agree or disagree with national trends. We will also compare the amount of study hours between the courses taught by professors of the same department, this will serve as an indicator on how rigorous classes may be, which may point to the differences in grade distributions.\n",
